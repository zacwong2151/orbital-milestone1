**FoundIt**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Motivation </span>**

If you have ever lost your belonging in NUS before, you would likely have experienced the trouble and frustration of trying to find it. Similarly, if you have found an item and want to return it to its rightful owner, you would likely have been clueless about how to reach out to the owner of the item. 

We ourselves, having combed through the numerous NUS Lost & Found platforms, find them inadequate in matching the lost items to their owners. The information in NUS Lost & Found RepoApp is cluttered, and there is no picture attached to each lost item. The NUS Lost and Found telegram group chat has too many messages, and there is no standardisation of the information of the lost item, eg. vague or incomplete information.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Aim </span>**

We aim to develop a one-stop-shop for NUS students and staff in the form of a webapp that addresses all the issues that the other platforms face, and make the process easier for students to find or report lost items.

    **1. User login**

With user login, you are able to personalise your account as well as communicate with others.

**2. Item viewing**

Item viewing allows you to view and filter lost and found items. From here, users can locate their lost item or match an item they have found by searching or filtering by categories.

**3. Image search**

In the event that the user is unsure of what the item is or unsure of how to describe the item, image search allows users to search using a picture of the item they have found. 

**4. Notification**

After you report your missing item, you will be notified when someone has found something similar.
